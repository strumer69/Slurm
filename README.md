# Slurm
## overview:
* https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html
* Slurm is an open source, fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster management and job scheduling system for large and small Linux clusters.
* Slurm requires **no kernel modifications** for its operation and is relatively self-contained. As a **cluster workload manager**, Slurm has three key functions.
- First, it allocates exclusive and/or non-exclusive access to resources (compute nodes) to users for some duration of time so they can perform work.
- Second, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work (normally a parallel job) on the set of allocated nodes.
- Finally, it arbitrates contention for resources by managing a queue of pending work.
